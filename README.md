# Gold.fish üåäüêü

**Gold.fish** is a unique financial tracking web app that visualizes your income and expenses through the growth of a digital fish tank. As your income increases, your tank evolves from a simple fishbowl to a vast ocean, reflecting your financial journey. Track your expenses as "food" for your fish, watch your goldfish grow, and get inspired by rotating quotes and sayings at the top of your screen.

## Planned Features
- **Income Tracking**: Input your salary and other income sources to expand your fish tank.
- **Expense Management**: Log expenses and see how they impact your goldfish's size.
- **Tank Evolution**: Reach financial milestones to upgrade from a fishbowl to a pond, lake, or even an ocean.
- **Inspirational Quotes**: Enjoy dynamic quotes and sayings that keep you motivated.
- **Houses as Feeders**:
  - Houses act as feeders in the tank, symbolizing both growth and regular expenses.
  - Mortgage payments are represented as food dispensed to the fish, showing the outflow of money.
  - Appreciation in house value feeds the fish with additional food, reflecting increased wealth.
  - Ongoing expenses like maintenance and property taxes also contribute to feeding the fish.
- **Stock Market Investments as Dynamic Elements**:
  - Stock investments are visualized as a separate dynamic addon, such as a coral reef or bubbles, that expands or contracts based on investment performance.
  - Investments do not directly affect tank size but are shown as fluctuating assets, emphasizing their separate role from regular income.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js

## Future Plans
- **Mobile App**: Expand accessibility by migrating to mobile platforms using React Native or Flutter.
- **Enhanced Features**: Add budget analytics, goal setting, and community-driven financial tips.
